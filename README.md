<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

SuperGO2 is a server emulation of the old MMO flash game called Galaxy Online II, in this way the purpose of the project is to revive the game and help the entire community and players who enjoyed this excellent MMO to endure, also even if that is not enough, we have the hope of being able to improve the game, adding blueprints, commanders, constellations and more content than what it currently has and which remains the same content throughout all these years.

Read the `Play` section of this guide to know how to play the game.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Play (Beta)

> For play the beta you need to have a generated account. This account can only be obtainable if you are a qualified battle-reviewer, or during the closed beta draw that would be announced via discord when that phase starts.
