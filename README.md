<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

SuperGO2 is a server emulation of the old MMO flash game called Galaxy Online II, in this way the purpose of the project is to revive the game and help the entire community and players who enjoyed this excellent MMO to endure, also even if that is not enough, we have the hope of being able to improve the game, adding blueprints, commanders, constellations and more content than what it currently has and which remains the same content throughout all these years.

Read the `Play` section of this guide to know how to play the game.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Play (Beta)

To play the Closed Alpha you need to have a generated account. This account can only be obtained if you meet any of the following conditions:

- If you are a patron who donated in any of the 3 tiers and at any time before May 31 of this year.
- If you boost the official Discord before May 31 of this year.
- If you have the Battle Reviewer role.
- If you have the Influencer role.
- If you are a member of the Staff.
- Also, in the next 3 months, there will be several draws on Discord, where there will always be 3 winners who will get an account to play.

> Anyone who has access to the Closed-Alpha phase will have an additional role on Discord called @Alpha Tester. If you meet any of the conditions given above, please contact with Toxic#5000 in Discord.
